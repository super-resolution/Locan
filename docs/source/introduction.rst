.. _introduction:

Locan is a python-based library with code for analyzing fluoresence super-resolution
microscopy data. The acronym might stand for **su**\ per-**re**\ solution **py**\ thon.

Locan provides a collection of tools for analyzing single-molecule
localization data. Such data is typically generated in fluorescence-based super-resolution microscopy methods.
Single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) techniques rely on finding the position of single-molecule
emitters in space and reconstructing a super-resolved image over time.
The generated localizations are analyzed point-by-point for statistical and structural insight.
