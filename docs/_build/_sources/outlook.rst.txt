Outlook
===========================

Surepy will provide data structures and methods for working with single-molecule localization data. Here we outline
long term development ideas.


Data structures:
================

In addition to the basic data class LocData as outlined in :ref:`Data structures <datastructures>`,
Surepy might have to provide special classes for advanced analysis routines and the results generated by them:

* class Analysis_results()

Analysis_results objects will serve as input in secondary analysis routines.


Batch processing:
=================

Both, batch processing on several datasets and setting up an analysis pipeline will be carried out most convenient by
running a python script. For offering batch processing and pipeline analysis to all microscope users via a general
user interface, a predefined concept will be helpful.


Logging:
=================

For user-controlled batch processing and analysis pipelines a logging procedure will help to control and supervise the
process. Logging could be introduced based on the logging package in the standard python library.


Analysis Methods:
=================

Surepy provides methods to work on locdata and perform localization data
analysis. On the long run several analysis routines will be helpful:


    * Fourier_shell_correlation()
        Compute fourier shell correlation for localization coordinates as measure of resolution.

    * Property_plot()
        Present and analyze the histogram of a locdata property.

    * Property_correlation()
        Present and analyze the correlation between two locdata properties.

    * Statistics_report()
        Provide a printable form of selected statistics on locdata properties.

    * Quality_report()
        Provide a printable form of selected analysis procedures to check imaging quality.

    * Ripley()
        Compute Ripley k function for locdata coordinates.

    * Nearest_neighbor_distances()
        Compute k nearest neighbor distance distributions for locdata coordinates.

    * Coordinate_based_colocalization()
        Compute localization-based colocalization values for two distinct sets of locdata coordinates.

    * Region_overlay()
        Compute spatial overlay of hulls from two dataset with locdata hulls.

    * Point_region_distances()
        Analyze distances between locdata coordinates and hull regions in a locdata collection (center and boundary).

    * Serial_clustering()
        Plot property series from locdata in a collection (e.g. clustering results)
