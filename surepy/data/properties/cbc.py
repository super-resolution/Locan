Coordinate-based colocalization.

Colocalization is estimated by computing a colocalization index for each localization
using the so-called coordinate-based colocalization algorithm [1]_.

    """
    Compute a colocalization index for each localization by coordinate-based colocalization.

    The colocalization index is calculated for each point in <points_1> by finding nearest neighbors in <points_1>
    or <points_2> within radius. A normalized number of nearest neighbors at a certain radius is computer for
    n_steps of increasing radii ranging from 0 to <radius> in steps of <n_steps>.
    The Spearman rank correlation coefficent is computed for these values and weighted by
    Exp[-nearestNeighborDistance/distanceMax].

    Parameters
    ----------
    points_1 : array of tuple
        Array of points (each point represented by a tuple with coordinates) for which CBC values are computed.

    points_2 : array of tuple
        Array of points (each represented by a tuple with coordinates) to be compared with points_1

    radius : int or float
        The maximum radius up to which nearest neighbors are determined

    n_steps : int
        The number of bins from which Spearman correlation is computed.

    Returns
    -------
    np.array
        An array with coordinate-based colocalization coefficients for each input point.
