Aim
==========================

We aim at providing a python package with data structures and methods for analyzing single-molecule localization data.
Surepy is a Python package providing functionality to load and manipulate localization data and to perform various
analysis procedures.

The package provides:

    * a class structure for localization data with apppropriate meta data
    * rendering functions to visualize localization data
    * methods for carrying out analysis routines
    * an interface to save analysis results using an appropriate file structure.


The package can be used in Python scripts or Jupyther notebooks.
