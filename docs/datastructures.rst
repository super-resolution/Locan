Surepy will provide LocData as the one data class to deal with the following data structures:

    1) localization data
    2) selections of localization data
    3) collections of selections


Comments on LocData:
----------------------------

1) Localization data consists of a list of localization data. Each localization has several properties (detailed list
    in :ref:`properties`) like

        * coordinates
        * intensity
        * frame
        * ...

    There is no fundamental difference between 2D and 3D localization data.

    Multiple sets of localization data like two-color localizations will be represented by independent Dataset objects.

    The unit for length throughout the project is given by the input unit for localization coordinates. In most cases
    the unit will be nanometre.


2) A LocData object that is instantiated from localization data has some single-number-properties describing the
    dataset as a whole. Such properties could be (detailed list in :ref:`properties`):

        * total number of localizations
        * centroid
        * total emission strength
        * area/volume (for all possible hulls)
        * ...


3) Selections: A LocData object can also be instantiated from a selection of localizations. Selections carry a reference to
    another LocData object and a list of selected indices to not copy the original dataset with all localization
    properties for each Selection. This way a large set of Selections can be created with minimal memory requirements.


4) Collection: A LocData object can also represent a list of selections as e.g. generated by clustering the
    localization data. The dataset of a collection consists of the list of all properties from the collected
    selections.


5) For the spatial coordinates in each LocData object there are various hulls that might be of interest:

        1. minimal bounding box
        #. minimal oriented bounding box
        #. convex hull
        #. alpha complex

    These hulls are provided from stand-alone methods with attributes such as 'Region_measure' that can can be added
    as new property to teh corresponding LocData object.
