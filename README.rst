What is Surepy?
===============

Surepy (sure it's python but also super-resolution) is a collection of tools for analyzing single-molecule
localization data. Such data is typically generated in fluorescence-based super-resolution microscopy methods.
Single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) techniques rely on finding the position of single-molecule
emitters in space and reconstructing a super-resolved image over time.
The generated localizations are analyzed point-by-point for statistical and structural insight.

Implementation notes
--------------------

This library is based on Python 3, QT, the standard SciPy and additional packages as listed in environment.yml.
